These are my custom Stylish styles.

### What is Stylish?
Stylish is a [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/), [Safari](http://sobolev.us/stylish/), and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish/) extension that allows us to add additional CSS stylesheets to any webpage, adjusting the appearence to our desire.

Each folder has a readme explaining what I fixed or adjusted.
